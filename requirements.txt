Hangman
Jeopardy
The objectives of this project are:

Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript/jQuery
Solidify front-end skills by prototyping and building a site using HTML and CSS

You will be working individually for this first project, but we'll be giving you direction this time. Show us what you've got!

CHALLENGE ADD-ONS

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

Add avatar choices for the player
Artificial Intelligence

Things to keep in mind

Make sure that your code is:

Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
Sufficiently commented. Will I understand what is going on in each block or function? If it's not clear, are there comments that indicate what you're doing?
Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
Time Management. Focus on core requirements (minimum viable product) before spending a lot of time on "bells and whistles."
We'll also be looking at:

Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you think through alternative implementations?
Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself. How did you approach any new libraries/technologies and extend your learning into a working game?
